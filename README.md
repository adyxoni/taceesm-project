# taceesm-project
TACEESM project, funded by the European Union through the Erasmus+ programme. My university assigned a task to me and two other colleagues to finish a webpage for the TACEESM Project 20/23. 
In this repository you will find the file instructions.docx where you can see the tasks that I received and the end product of it is available in index.html file. I have also posted all other necessary files for this website.

As a team, we finished the landing page (index.html) where I contributed to creating the header of the website (Icons for linked in and facebook - currently without href, and the european union top left image) and footer (Our partners). 
The dissemination and partners pages are completely my work, however we haven't received any further instructions for it at the moment.

NOTE: THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS.
